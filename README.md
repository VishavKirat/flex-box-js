# Flex Box Practice

This is the flex box practice excercise (I'm not using flex grow as Safari supports flex propertyName where as chrome supports flex-grow)

## Get Started

After cloning this project run the following commands.

Firstly,
In terminal run command :

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all the dependencies required to run this project.

Then,
You need to make a .env file in home directory and create variables PORT and NEWS_API_KEY (You can get one from [here](https://newsapi.org/))

Next,
In terminal run,

```bash
npm run dev
webpack-dev-server
```

I havenot use concurrently here(on purpose) but you can install it and can add your custom script in package.json.
